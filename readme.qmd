# Required software

You should have several software applications installed before the start of the course:

- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- [RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) or [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) or [VSCodium](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or the [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

You do not need to know what all of these do and we have limited time available to help you get them running, but ideally they all work beforehand.

Most R packages install quickly, but you can get ahead and run this code in a new R session to find and install all required packages:

```{r}
#| eval: false
if (!requireNamespace("rlang", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("rlang", dependencies = TRUE)
rlang::check_installed("attachment")
rlang::check_installed(attachment::att_from_qmds(path = ".", recursive = TRUE))
```
